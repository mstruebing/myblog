# Hello everybody

I would recommend a very good JS tutorial which helped me a lot to understand test driven design and the whole react/redux architecture.

In this tutorial you build a full stack Javascript Redux voting app.

It is very easy if you have a little basics and really nice to read and explained.
You get everything you have to know out of this article and also if you want more information there are links to the specific subject available.

Not all is working without problems, but if you are able to read and so on you should master it.
If you have any questions feel free to contact me.
