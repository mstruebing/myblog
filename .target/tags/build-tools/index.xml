      <description>Introduction I&amp;rsquo;m writing this because I have the feeling that many developers underestimate the power of Makefiles and they are simply not aware of this nice and handy tool which is installed on nearly every Unix-like machine. To be honest, who have never executed a make install or something similar? Most tutorials I&amp;rsquo;ve found out there are bloated with stuff, more complex than they would have to and you have to read pages after pages to get the basics.</description>
