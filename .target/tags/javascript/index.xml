      <description>Because no one should be shell-scripting inside a JSON file.
 That&amp;rsquo;s cool, but why should I use scripty? I could do this well without.
What is the advantage of another dependency in my project?
Recently I had to work on a project and the build were broken because of an update of scripty. That wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a problem if our version constraints were more strict or we would had a shrinkwrap.</description>
