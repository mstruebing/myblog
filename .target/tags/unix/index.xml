      <description>Introduction I&amp;rsquo;m writing this because I have the feeling that many developers underestimate the power of Makefiles and they are simply not aware of this nice and handy tool which is installed on nearly every Unix-like machine. To be honest, who have never executed a make install or something similar? Most tutorials I&amp;rsquo;ve found out there are bloated with stuff, more complex than they would have to and you have to read pages after pages to get the basics.</description>

      <description>Wc is a small handy tool which I use often. I&amp;rsquo;m calling it word-count in my head.(Today I learned by looking wc up on Wikipedia: it is actually called word count) It is part of the GNU coreutils it should be on nearly any system.
What can you do with wc? With wc you can simply count lines, words or characters of a file or string, and thats it. Nothing more or less.</description>

For example if we have multiple .</description>
