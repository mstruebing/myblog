      <title>Dont Fear the Makefile</title>

      <description>Introduction I&amp;rsquo;m writing this because I have the feeling that many developers underestimate the power of Makefiles and they are simply not aware of this nice and handy tool which is installed on nearly every Unix-like machine. To be honest, who have never executed a make install or something similar? Most tutorials I&amp;rsquo;ve found out there are bloated with stuff, more complex than they would have to and you have to read pages after pages to get the basics.</description>

      <description>Introduction I&amp;rsquo;ve finally managed to get a Raspberry Pi. I&amp;rsquo;ve already thought a long time of buying one, but because of missing ideas what to do with it I didn&amp;rsquo;t buy one. A school project came by which served the perfect reason to finally buy one (hint: self made monitoring camera) and now I&amp;rsquo;m lucky to have one.
Mopidy and stuff So what is running on my RPI now? Currently there is a raspian installed and except the whole music-server-software nothing special.</description>

      <title>Why I like wc</title>

      <description>Wc is a small handy tool which I use often. I&amp;rsquo;m calling it word-count in my head.(Today I learned by looking wc up on Wikipedia: it is actually called word count) It is part of the GNU coreutils it should be on nearly any system.
What can you do with wc? With wc you can simply count lines, words or characters of a file or string, and thats it. Nothing more or less.</description>

      <title>You might not need scripty</title>

      <description>Because no one should be shell-scripting inside a JSON file.
 That&amp;rsquo;s cool, but why should I use scripty? I could do this well without.
What is the advantage of another dependency in my project?
Recently I had to work on a project and the build were broken because of an update of scripty. That wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a problem if our version constraints were more strict or we would had a shrinkwrap.</description>

      <description>Hello everybody In this post I will show you how you can execute multiple commands on files via find.
Firstly how to use find:
find -type f -iname &amp;#34;*.extension&amp;#34; This will find all files under the working dir with the given extension. Of course you can use other things like filesize, user who owns that file etc. But for that example I will using this.
For example if we have multiple .</description>

      <description>Hello folks,
I want to write a small tutorial on how to write a simple CLI-tool in Haskell.
For all who did not know, Haskell is a pure functional programming language which was released in 1990. What I personally like the most is list comprehension, this is a really powerful and great feature. But there are also other really cool things like maybe for example. It is really packed with a lot of cool stuff.</description>
