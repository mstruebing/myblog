title: "Projects"
---

Here are my own projects I've built or I'm maintaining.
They aren't in a specific order. Some were made to solve a problem, some 
just for learning purpose and some assignments or homeworks of vocational 
school.

---

## Elmodoro:
[Code](https://github.com/mstruebing/elmodoro)  
[InAction](https://pomodoro.maex.me/)

An __Elm__ implementation of the popular pomodoro timer.

---

## [TLDR](https://github.com/mstruebing/tldr)

A command line client implementation to print pages from 
[tldr-pages](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr) in __Golang__.
A very cool project to collect most used command line parameters of nearly 
every command line client program out there. Very handy in day to day usage.

---

## [Editorconfig-checker](https://github.com/editorconfig-checker)

This is a code quality tool to ensure that your files respect the definitions of
the `.editorconfig`-file inside your projects.
I've finished the implementation in two languages already:

* [Editorconfig-checker.php](https://github.com/editorconfig-checker/editorconfig-checker.php)
* [Editorconfig-checker.javascript](https://github.com/editorconfig-checker/editorconfig-checker.javascript)

## [web-s](https://github.com/mstruebing/web-s)

This is a __NodeJS__ implementation to start a web search in your 
default browser where the search engines are extensible via a 
simple configuration file.

---

## [koa-url-shortener](https://github.com/mstruebing/koa-url-shortener)

A __NodeJS__ URL-shortener which saves the URL's inside a __MongoDB__.
This is also the first project where I used __docker__ and __Travis-CI__.

---

## [todo.hs](https://github.com/mstruebing/todo.hs)
This is a terminal todo application written in __Haskell__ and was made 
with lots of love and the motivation to build my first real usable __Haskell__ 
project.

---

## [cat.hs](https://github.com/mstruebing/cat.hs)
An implementation of the Unix cat command in __Haskell__.
This was a project just for learning purpose.

---

## [password-manager](https://github.com/mstruebing/password-manager)

A multi-user password manager written in __Java__. 
I've tried to use __domain driven design__ and tried to write a generic 
__repository__ in this project which was a homework assignment.

---

## [weather-stations](https://github.com/mstruebing/weather-station)

This was a weather station which was the outcome of a school project.
Sadly I didn't have the __Arduino__ part which posted data to a __Golang__ 
API which can be found in the code. This was my first __Golang__ project 
and it was a lot  of fun.  
I've build the frontend with __ReactJS__ and used __ChartJS__ to display the 
data.

---

## [rpi-motion-detector](https://github.com/mstruebing/rpi-motion-detector)

This is a motion detector which was also a school project.
An Raspberry PI got connected to a webcam and ran the motion daemon which 
can be configured to take videos or pictures when something 
changes in the picture the webcam is looking at.
I've build the frontend with __Elm__ and it was the first time I was using 
this language and fell in love. :) The rest are just some bash scripts and 
a simple __PHP__-based API receive the images from the frontend.
