## About Me

### General

Hi, I'm Max from Hamburg/Germany. I'm coding since 2012 and I currently work for [sitegeist media solutions GmbH](https://www.sitegeist.de). Since July 2017 I'm also an active [Neos](https://www.neos.io) core [team member](https://www.neos.io/community/teams.html).

In general I'm interested in all kinds of computer science but my main focus is clearly in web development since this is my day to day job.
