## About Me

### General

Hi, I'm Max from Hamburg/Germany. I'm coding since 2012 and I'm currently working for [D2iQ](https://d2iq.com) as a Senior Software Engineer working on a cloud platform.

From July 2017 until January 2019 I was an active [Neos](https://www.neos.io) core [team member](https://www.neos.io/community/teams.html) where I worked mostly on the [React](https://reactjs.org/)/[Redux](https://redux.js.org/) user interface for editors.

In general I'm interested in all kinds of computer science but my main focus is clearly in web development since this is my day to day job.

If you want to know more about me or my projects you can visit my [GitHub](https://github.com/mstruebing) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mxstrbng) profile.
